WEBVTT - The solar system

00:00.500 --> 00:04.000
Our solar system
consists of 8 planets.

00:04.001 --> 00:09.000
These turn on themselves
and around the Sun.

00:09.001 --> 00:13.000
The first 4 planets are
telluric, rocky.

00:13.001 --> 00:14.800
They have a floor.

00:14.801 --> 00:18.000
On the other hand, the last 4 are carbonated.


00:18.001 --> 00:20.200
They have no ground.

00:20.201 --> 00:24.500
Let's start with the first planet
telluric: Mercury.

00:24.501 --> 00:28.000
It is the smallest and
closest to the Sun.

00:28.001 --> 00:32.000
The second terrestrial planet is Venus.

00:32.001 --> 00:34.000
It is the hottest planet.

00:36.001 --> 00:42.000
The third telluric planet is the
Earth, or the blue planet.

00:42.001 --> 00:46.000
This is the planet we live on!

00:47.001 --> 00:51.000
The fourth and last
telluric planet,

00:51.001 --> 00:53.000
It's March!

00:53.001 --> 00:57.000
It remains the preferred target
space missions.

00:57.001 --> 01:02.000
The fifth planet is Jupiter.
It's the biggest planet

01:02.001 --> 01:03.300
in our Solar System.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
Saturn is the gas giant.
It has rings

01:08.001 --> 01:13.000
and many natural satellites!

01:17.001 --> 01:23.000
For the seventh planet,
Itâ€™s Uranus! It does it

01:23.001 --> 01:27.000
circumference of the sun in 84 years.

01:29.001 --> 01:35.500
The last planet, or the
fourth gaseous is Neptune!

01:35.501 --> 01:39.000
It has thirteen
natural satellites.
